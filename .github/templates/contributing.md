## Contributing

If you have a script you would like to share to the community or improvements on an existing script, your help is welcome!

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a [personal fork](https://github.com/zeronetworks/Community/fork) of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Add your script to an existing folder/subfolder or update an existing script with your improvements.
- Comment the script so others can understand how the code works.
- Commit and push your changes to your remote repo `origin`.
- Submit a pull request so your changes can be reviewed and added to `Zero Networks Community Repo`.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo.
